# 🚀 About the Repository

This repository includes a variety of beginner to intermediate-level Python projects.
The main goal is to practice coding, build logic, and explore real-world applications of Python.

## You’ll find projects related to:

✅ Basic Python concepts

🧮 Data analysis and visualization

🕹️ Mini games and automation scripts

🧠 Algorithms and problem-solving

🌐 APIs and web scraping

🧰 File handling, SQL, and data manipulation

🗂️ Project Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a separate mini project:
<pre>
📁 python-mini-projects/
├── project_1_name/
